# Optimized-Data-Processing-Framework
This project showcases a comparative analysis of various data processing techniques, focusing on sorting and statistical computations. The implemented methods utilize Python's standard libraries, multithreading, and Dask for performance optimization, demonstrating how different approaches can handle large datasets efficiently.

Optimized Data Processing Framework
Overview
This project implements and compares multiple methods for processing large datasets, focusing on sorting and statistical calculations. It highlights the performance of basic, multithreaded, and distributed approaches using Python libraries. The results are visualized to showcase the differences in execution times between each method.

Features
Sorting Algorithms:

Basic sorting using Python's built-in sorted function.
Multithreaded sorting using ThreadPoolExecutor.
Distributed sorting with Dask for handling large-scale data.
Statistical Analysis:

Computation of mean, median, and standard deviation.
Multithreaded computation for increased efficiency.
Performance Benchmarking:

Measures execution time of each method.
Caches results for faster repeated runs.
Visualizes runtime differences using a bar chart.
Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/MakazhanAlpamys/Optimized-Data-Processing-Framework.git
cd Optimized-Data-Processing-Framework
Install the required dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the main script:

bash
python main.py
Observe the performance results in the console output.

A bar chart will be displayed at the end comparing execution times for each method.

Example Output
Hereâ€™s what you can expect:

Console:

basic_sort took 0.5301 seconds
threaded_sort took 0.2403 seconds
dask_sort took 0.1809 seconds
basic_summary took 0.1502 seconds
threaded_summary took 0.0801 seconds
Visualization:
A bar chart showing the performance comparison of sorting and statistical methods.
